# Grab Data Science Challenge 2022 

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to generate valuable insights and provide recommendations to help Grab alleviate issues related to delays in their transport services. By leveraging predictive modeling techniques, we aim to enhance Grab's operational efficiency and improve the overall experience for users.

## Data Preparation
A crucial phase of our project involved meticulous data preparation. We adopted a 60-20-20 split ratio for training data, validation data, and test data, respectively. This ensured a robust evaluation of the predictive models. The quality of the data is paramount, and our data engineer, Iffah, played a pivotal role in preparing a clean and well-structured dataset.

## Predictive Model
For our predictive modeling, we employed the powerful Gradient Boosting technique. This model, applied to the Grab-Posisi dataset, was selected for its ability to handle complex relationships in the data and provide accurate predictions. The model's importance lies in its capability to analyze various factors affecting delays in Grab's transport services.

## Model Analysis
Our analysis phase delved into the performance of the predictive models. We observed notable reductions in error values compared to naive models, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach. The advantages gained from utilizing Gradient Boosting were evident in the model's ability to capture intricate patterns within the data, contributing to more reliable predictions.

## Limitations
Despite our efforts, we encountered certain limitations during the analysis. The model, in some instances, did not meet our expectations, leading to an unsatisfactory level of confidence. These challenges underscore the complexity of the issues related to delays in transport services, and we recognize the need for continuous refinement.

## Further Improvements
To enhance the project further, we propose several avenues for improvement:
1. More Representative Target Variables: The inclusion of more representative target variables could refine the model's predictions and provide a more accurate reflection of delays.
2. Exploration of Density as an Option: Exploring density-related features might offer additional insights into areas with higher service demands, contributing to a more nuanced analysis.
3. Use of Different Models: Experimenting with different models, such as non-linear SVM, could provide a comprehensive understanding of the data, leading to more robust predictions.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, our analysis of the Grab-Posisi dataset has yielded valuable insights into factors influencing delays in transport services. While we acknowledge the encountered limitations, the project sets the foundation for ongoing improvements. We remain committed to refining our models and exploring innovative approaches to contribute positively to Grab's service optimization efforts.
